# Disruptive Cyberattacks in Ukraine - Collated Threat Indicators

For ease of reference, Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ researchers are collating a list of validated threat indicators from cyberattacks linked to the current situation in Ukraine. Please note that the list may also contain threat indicators associated with Russian threat groups that are recently disclosed, but not necessarily directly related to attacks in Ukraine. Note that IP addresses can be reallocated. The IP addresses and domains may contain malicious content, so consider the risks before opening them in a browser.

The link provided in the 'References' column is intended to point to publicly available reporting that gives broader context on the threat indicator. We recognize that it may not be the first report in which the indicator was identified.

The list of threat indicators is based on current information and is subject to change as new information is gathered. It may not be comprehensive.
